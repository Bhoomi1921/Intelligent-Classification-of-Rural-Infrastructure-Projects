## üí° Project: Intelligent Classification of Rural Infrastructure Projects

### üß© Problem Statement
The **Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)** includes various rural development schemes like PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, and RCPLWEA. Classifying projects into these schemes manually is inefficient, error-prone, and non-scalable.

### ‚úÖ Proposed Solution
An **AI-powered classification system** was built using IBM Watsonx.ai to automatically categorize rural road projects into the correct PMGSY scheme using attributes like cost, length, state, and project duration. The final model was deployed as a web service for real-time predictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
- **Cloud Platform:** IBM Cloud
- **AI Platform:** IBM Watsonx.ai Studio
- **AutoML Engine:** IBM AutoAI
- **Core Technologies:**
  - Python
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Scikit-learn, XGBoost
  - Matplotlib (for EDA)
  - Watsonx SDK

---

## üöÄ System Development Workflow
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Source: [AI Kosh PMGSY Dataset](https://aikosh.indiaai.gov.in/web/datasets/details/pradhan_mantri_gram_sadak_yojna_pmgsy.html)  
   - Included fields like project cost, road length, state, scheme label, etc.

2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**  
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical data  
   - Derived features such as cost per km, project duration  

3. **Model Training with AutoAI:**  
   - Launched AutoAI experiment with 10 pipelines  
   - Pipeline 10 using **Random Forest Classifier** performed best  

4. **Model Deployment:**  
   - Exported the model to Watsonx Deployment Space  
   - REST API enabled real-time prediction using JSON input

## üìä Algorithm & Deployment

- **Selected Algorithm:** `Random Forest Classifier`  
- **Why Random Forest?**  
  - High accuracy for structured/tabular data  
  - Handles mixed feature types  
  - Robust to class imbalance

- **Input Features Used:**
  - `STATE_NAME`
  - `DISTRICT_NAME`
  - `LENGTH_OF_ROAD_WORK_SANCTIONED`
  - `COST_OF_WORKS_SANCTIONED`
  - `NO_OF_ROAD_WORK_SANCTIONED`
  - `EXPENDITURE_OCCURED`
  - `LENGTH_OF_ROAD_WORK_COMPLETED`
  - `NO_OF_ROAD_WORKS_COMPLETED`

- **Output:**  
  - Predicted Scheme Label (e.g., PMGSY-I, II)  
  - Confidence Score (e.g., 90% for Pipeline #10)
